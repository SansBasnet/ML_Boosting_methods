# Support Vector Machine and other Discriminant Analysis methods

There are two codes one for classification and the other for regression. If the label is continuous it is called a regression problem, if it categorical it is a classification problem. Here the Diabetes dataset is for classification because it has many columns such as age, sex, BMI... which is a categorical dataset. Whilst, wine quality is a continuous dataset with the quality of wine in different times.
